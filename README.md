This project was created as part of the curriculum for Springboard's Software Engineering Certification.

In this app, I used React and JS to create an interactive blackjack card game. The game has the ability to keep score, declare a winner, and restart the game.

A new deck is acquired and shuffled through the deck of cards api at https://deckofcardsapi.com/
